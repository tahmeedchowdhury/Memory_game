Submitted by: Tahmeed Chowdhury

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [X] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [X] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[The sites I used are the following:
https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ - To find color codes and names
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document - To study more about Document properties in HTML.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API - To get a little more information on HTML and its capabilities

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered while completing this submission is the relations between the different file
types and methods. To be more precise, as I completed more and more of the submission, I had more trouble
keeping up with how variable values changed and differed in between each event and how the different files 
(the CSS file, the index file, and the script file) all connected with each other to create the final cohesive 
submission. To overcome this, I decided to slow down the pace at which I was completing the submission and
experiment with the functions and variable values. I took a little more time to complete each step of the 
submission and examined how differences in values resulted in differences in the program. For example, I 
changed the value of the delays and times, the size of the pattern array, styles of the buttons and their
classes, as well as how some of the given functions for the tone. With each change, I examined what the 
resulting differences were and studied how each line of the program affected the whole. Through this process,
I was able to get a much better understanding of the overall program and how it is connected along with what 
the specific functions do. I was able to get a much better understanding of the program, and through it make
some of the additional changes to the program such as adding more buttons and randomizing the pattern with each
start of the game.



3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
This submission has helped me to get a feel for what the SITE program might be like. It was also a
helpful refresher on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts necessary for programming. I have a few questions
regarding web development after this submission. The main questions that I have is how are bigger projects
in the real world organized to be efficient and easy to understand?  Furthermore, what sort of concepts and 
logic go into creating some of the more intricate parts of a website such as the drop-down menus or
animations within the webpage? After seeing how CSS is used, I am interested in seeing how it can be
expanded to do more for a website. Lastly, I would like to know what else JavaScript can be used to do 
for a webpage. This submission did a few thing with JavaScript, and I would like to see the other
capabilities the language has for web development.



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
With more time, I would consider adding a few more functionalities. One example is to add more 
interactive buttons. I would want to allow the buttons to move or switch locations so that they arenâ€™t
always in the same place. The same-colored buttons are pressed in the pattern, but the physical button 
will change its location on the screen. This change would increase the difficulty in a different manner
than changing time limits or tries as it changes how the player would approach the game. They would 
have a more challenging time following the pattern as the position would be changing and remembering
the location of the tiles would do them no good. Some other changes I would make with more time are 
to add some of the suggested changes such as a timer, or multiple tries. This adds more depth to the 
game and makes it more interesting. Lastly, I would consider making the button designs slightly different 
with images or adding some more complex sounds to make the game more fun to play.
